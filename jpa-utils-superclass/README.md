Project Name

Description

This project aims to provide a collection of useful and reusable
Java classes that can be packaged into a JAR file. 
These classes are intended to be used as a source for 
other projects, enabling easy extension and implementation 
of common functionalities. By centralizing commonly used classes, constants, and configurations, 
this project aims to reduce the effort required for creating configuration and processes entities in common projects.

Installation

To reuse the classes in another application, copy the generated JAR file (jpa-classes.jar) to the desired location in the new application.
